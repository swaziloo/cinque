# The Story
I've used ortholinear and mechanical keyboards for years.
Upon discovering [Ergogen](https://ergogen.xyz/) 
and the [Flat Foot Fox](https://flatfootfox.com/) tutorials 
I began a process of studying the size and shape of my hand
which led to 3D printed switch holders with which I further refined the shape of cinque.

I wanted a compact upgrade akin to my [Atreus](https://atreus.technomancy.us/) keyboard,
since I found it too limiting for a software development daily driver.
My goals were comfort, compact, and trackball.

My efforts moved to learning KiCad and figuring out how to trace a PCB 
(I would ultimately lay out the complete project three times).
I was convinced by a friend that I *must* include matrix RGB lighting..
Checking the production cost, it seemed a small difference to go single-sided.

While wrapping up the PCB layout I began testing the trackball integration, 
which I wanted in the middle of the keyboard,
large (originally a 57.25mm billiard ball),
and to "hang off" the extra pins a RP2040 ProMicro would provide.

The PCBs would include small breakout boards to mount the switches and lights 
and string it together with JST connectors to support experimenting with the fundamentals of the trackball.

Once I got the PCBs in hand

and the first keyboard up and running
![first cinque build](images/cinque0010.jpg)
the job switched to case design.

Ultimately I ditched the billiard ball,
as it tracked poorly and pushed the keyboard halves apart.

There's a lot going on in the trackball housing.

I've also built the wireless/Nice!View board with a spacer. 
There's room for a large lipo battery beneath each half.

And here's where things stand in June 2025:

Thanks for taking a look. 
Yes, I'm writing all this on the cinque.
It is my daily driver for work and play.

I appreciate any comments or ideas.
